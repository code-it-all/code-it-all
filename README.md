## 📖 How I Work / My Workflow

- **Plan**: Sketch UI, draft data flow, and design interactions before coding.  
- **Build small**: Start with core features first, then expand.  
- **Practice clean code**: Keep functions small, named, and readable.  
- **Iterate & refactor**: Regularly revisit old projects to improve structure and add features.  
- **Learn by doing**: Explore new tools, APIs, and libraries through side projects.
